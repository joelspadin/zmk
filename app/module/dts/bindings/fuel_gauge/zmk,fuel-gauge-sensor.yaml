  Battery SoC monitoring using a fuel gauge written with the sensor API

  This driver wraps one of the fuel gauge drivers that was written with the
  sensor API (e.g. maxim,max17055, maxim,max17262, or ti,bq274xx) so it supports
  the fuel gauge API and can be used for ZMK battery monitoring.

compatible: "zmk,fuel-gauge-sensor"

properties:
  sensor:
    type: phandle
    required: true
